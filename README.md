> PartlyFancy is currently in development to be the best it can possibly be. For the future, a Premium version might be released on Spigot. This plugin is a lot to keep up with and no help or donation gives me no motivation to do so.

**Current Dev. Stage**: Starting on Cosmetic item structuring

# FAQ

### What is PartlyFancy?
PartlyFancy provides a hub of cosmetic items to use on your Minecraft server. From fun and wacky particle effects to outragous and exciting gadgets, PartlyFancy will fullfill all your cosmetic needs. 

### Is this free to use?
PartlyFancy is free to download and use from the [PartlyFancy](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/partlyfancy "PartlyFancy Bukkit Page") page at [dev.bukkit.org](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/ "Bukkit Projects Page"). In the future, I hope to make two version: 
* FullyFancy and PartlyFancy. FullyFancy would be a spin-off of PartlyFancy encompassing more features and configuration. The modification of prefixes, items, inventories, etc. will be available in all of it's own seperate configurations. for the price of 1 USD, yes a single US dollar. This would **not** be available for open source and will be encrypted to prevent spread of code.
* PartlyFancy would be a more restricted and more a basic version containing less features and no root configuration. Once FullyFancy would be released, the additions to PartlyFancy would solely be from the community, not me; however, additions would still be approved by me. Another downside once FullyFancy's release, this plugin will not be pre-built for use follwing the release, meaning in order to use it for free with the most recent features, the person wanting the plugin will have to compile it themselves.

> FullyFancy is an idea and is not soldified or gaurenteed to happen. It is just an idea to get something out of PartlyFancy to support my computer science career and furthermore the project itself.

### Can I be an admin of the PartlyFancy project?
Good GitHub history, the ability to show your potential towards the project, and my invitation will grant a person access to work on PartlyFancy as an admin granting the premissions to approve merge requests, make hot-fixes, help with bug-reports, and manage the Bukkit page.

### Why is it open source?
When making this project open source, I hope to allow the community to provide their own ideas and cosmetic items for all to use. A plugin to have fun needs the input of many users in order to accomadate to multiple audiences and give the most well-versed experience. PartlyFancy will have a full-stack API in order to add your own gadgets, particle effects, pets, etc. However, not all will get approved because in the end I, Mick756, have final say of what goes into this project. If something is submited that I do not approve of, do not think meets the standards, or any other reason can get denied (with proper explination).

### How could I add to PartlyFancy?
I encourage anyone to add things to PartlyFancy! In order to start, clone the PartlyFancy master branch to your own computer add what you want, then push to your own branch. If I approve of what you added, great, you are a part of the adventure. If you are not approved, I will explain what needs to be changed/removed to meet the standards. If your module does not get approved for public usage, make it a module instead and add it to the module folder where it will be executed and injected into PartlyFancy.
